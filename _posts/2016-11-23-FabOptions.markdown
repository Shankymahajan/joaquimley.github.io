After seeing an awesome concept on [MaterialUp by Praveen Bisht](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/options-floating-interaction){:target="_blank"} for a multi funcation Fab component, I decided to build it into Android and finally release as an opensource library (already available jcenter()).

- You can find the code on **[Github](https://github.com/JoaquimLey/FabOptions){:target="_blank"}** with all the instructions.

- The sample is also available on the **[Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaquimley.faboptions.sample){:target="_blank"}** for preview.

- I'll write a blog post about the whole build and publish process soon, in the meantime if you have any questions or feedback you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/JoaquimLey/FabOptions/issues){:target="_blank"} or contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/JoaquimLey){:target="_blank"}.

Kudos to **Praveen Bisht** for the awesome idea and design!
