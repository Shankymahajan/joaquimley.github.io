After seeing an awesome concept on [MaterialUp by Praveen Bisht](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/options-floating-interaction){:target="_blank"} I decided to build it on Android and release it as a opensource library (already available jcenter()).

- You can find the code on **[Github](https://github.com/JoaquimLey/FabOptions){:target="_blank"}**

- The sample is also available on the **[Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaquimley.faboptions.sample){:target="_blank"}**

- I will write a blog post about the process soon, if you have any questions or feedback you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/JoaquimLey/FabOptions/issues) or contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/JoaquimLey)


Kudos to Praveen Bisht for the awesome idea and design!
